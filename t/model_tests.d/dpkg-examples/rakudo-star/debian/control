Description: Perl 6 implementation on top of Moar virtual machine
 Rakudo Perl is a compiler that implements the Perl 6 specification and runs on
 top of several virtual machines. Debian rakudo package runs on top of MoarVM.
 .
 Perl 6 is a programming language, member of the Perl family. Like Perl 5, her
 world-famous big sister, Perl 6 intends to carry forward the high ideals of
 the Perl community and is currently being developed by a team of dedicated and
 enthusiastic volunteers.
 .
 valgrind package installation is suggested to debug issues with
 perl6-valgrind-m program.
