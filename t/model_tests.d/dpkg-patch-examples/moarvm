Subject: Patch Configure.pl to determine version string correctly

The initial value of the version for MoarVM is found by looking at the
contents of the VERSION file.  If we are in a git working copy, however,
then the latest tag is used as the version number.  Unfortunately, in the
Debian repo, this tag isn't the one that MoarVM is expecting.  Thus for
Debian packaging it is correct to only use the contents of the VERSION file.
